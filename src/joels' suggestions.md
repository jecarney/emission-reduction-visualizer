joels' suggestions

- modal for information, can exit when click outside or click x
- see airbnb modal - https://www.airbnb.ca/ 
- checkboxes, with an information button that brings up the modal
- the tags in a sidebar - on mobile or desktop
- use a button to call the tags from the side... look at filters button on airbnb site
- then the 'add custom action' button lives beside the tags button
- title and brief description at top

Jule's notes on plan to implement Joel's suggestions
- take the tags and info section components out of the layout (for now)
- add the title and info section, with a brief explanation of how to use the page
- add the two buttons for add reduction actions and create new reduction action
- add the slideouts for those (can be an adjustment to existing 'actionview'?)
- change the buttons into checkboxes
- checkboxes have info beside them to explain the actions
- add modal with the extra info from the actions

Joel's suggestions part 2
- add title to form, and brief description of what add action does
- add title to checkbox section
- add gradient just from original to reductions node... visually shows something changing 
- add years at top of two columns - small
